/////////////////////////////////
Entry.java

1. input null checking and preprocessing(trim) can be implemented 
in separate member functions to avoid code duplicity.

2. Direct modification to parameters should be avoided. Add keyword 
final to input string, return a new string after trimming.

3. Need to rewrite equals() method for this class because in AddressBook 
line 47 it uses contains() method.

/////////////////////////////////
AddressBook.java

1. same as item 3 above. Or use another custom contains() method to decide
whether an Entry is in the list or not.

2. the name anyFieldsContainAll, nameContainAll etc. are confusing. Can 
consider name like searchaByAllEntry, searchByName, etc. 

3. the javadoc for nameContainAll, addressContainAll, etc. should be modified
accordingly rather than still using any of the fields like line 90.

4. the javadoc should also point out what exceptions the method will throw

5. in line 315, instead of using System.err.println(), can consider to log the
error and throw an exception 

6. line 322 is too long, should consider split it into several statements
